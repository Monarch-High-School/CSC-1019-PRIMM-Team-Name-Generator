## Predict
Answer the following questions *without running the repo**.

1. What is this program intended to do?
    > your answe

2. Do you think the program achieves its purpose? Give some example outputs that prove that it does/does not.
    > your answer


## Run
Run the program at least five times.

1. What does the program output? Give the outputs. 
    > your answer

2. Do these outputs prove that the program works as intended or not?
    > your answer

## Investigate
1. Write the docstring for `get_noun()`.
2. Write single line comments above the lines of code in `main()` to explain what it does.

### Which function is better?
1. What is the difference between the approach in `get_adjective()` and `get_noun()`?
    > Your answer

2. Which of the functions is better? Give an explanation as to why (**AP QUESTION**)
    > Your answer

### Lists
#### Major AP Concept
Lists allow you to store multiple related values in a single variable. You can use an index just like string to access the values. Lists help you keep the complexity under control or "manage the complexity" in a program by reducing the number of lines of code you need.

Look at the following table and compare to the code in the Python file. Complete the missing blanks.

| Code Statement                    | What happens                                |
| :------------                     | :-----------                                |
| `words: List[str] = []`           | Creates an empty list                       |
| `len(word)`                       | The value is 0 as nothing is in the list    |
| `words: List[str] = ["serendipity", "zeitgeist", "perspicacity"]` | MISSING |
| `words.append("pulchritude")`     | MISSING   |
| `words.insert(0, "dearth")`       | MISSING   |
| `words.insert(3, "paucity")`      | MISSING   |
| `words[0] = "proclivity"`         | MISSING   |
| `words.pop(1)`                    | MISSING   |
| `words.remove("truculence")`      | MISSING   |

## Modify
1. The function `get_noun()` only selects from a smaller set of words. Fix the function so chooses from the entire set of words.

## Make
1. Rewrite `get_adjective()` so it uses a list.
2. Add more fancy nouns and adjectives to the lists. You can either do it as an append or in the original initialization.
